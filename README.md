<p>Building games like this is an excellent way to practice your dev skills.</p>

<p>This game was created by utilizing HTML Canvas and JavaScript.</p>

<p>JavaScript uses a timer and some math randomization to load unpredictable new fleets of baddies for you.</p>

<p><strong>Caution,</strong> this may be more aggressive than the "Space Invaders" you're used to!</p>
